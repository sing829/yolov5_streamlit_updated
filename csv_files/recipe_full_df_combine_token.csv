Clear a flat space in your freezer. The bottom and back shelf are coldest. Have a 9-inch round or an 8 x 8 x 2-inch pan on hand, preferably metal. Glass or ceramic can be used, but will freeze much slower.
Place cocoa powder in a medium bowl. While coffee is still very hot (reheat it if yours has cooled), add about 蝧� cup of coffee to cocoa powder and whisk to make a smooth, thick slurry that is slightly thicker than heavy cream.
Add another 蝧� cup of coffee and stir until mixed. Stir in the remaining coffee.
Add sugar and whisk until it is dissolved. Whisk in cinnamon, vanilla, and milk. Pour into the baking pan and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. Re-stir the liquid, as the cocoa may have settled to the bottom, and place flat in the freezer.
After 1 to 2 hours, the mixture will start freezing along the edges (the timing of this will vary depending on the temperature of your freezer and the type of pan). Use a fork, with the tines curving downward, to scrape ice crystals from the pan edges and corners to the center. Mix to redistribute ice and liquid, breaking up the larger chunks.
Repeat the scraping, ice-breaking, and mixing every 1 to 2 hours. The mixture will become slushy. Continue until no liquid remains and slush is frozen solid. Once it is completely frozen, run the fork over mixture and scrape again (use some elbow grease!) to create thin flaky crystals.","{'calories': '73', 'total_fat': '1g', 'saturated_fat': '1g', 'cholesterol': '2mg', 'sodium': '13mg', 'carbohydrate': '16g', 'dietry_fibre': '1g', 'sugar': '15g', 'protein': '1g', 'vitamin': 'Vitamin D 0mcg', 'calcium': '33mg', 'iron': '0mg', 'potassium': '107mg'}",All,"High_blood_pressure, IBS",vegetarian,"Frozen,Cappuccino,Granita,Dessert,Recipe","2,cups,extra-strong,brewed,coffee,5,teaspoons,unsweetened,cocoa,powder,1/3,cup,sugar,1/8,teaspoon,ground,cinnamon,蝧�,teaspoon,vanilla,extract,蝧�,cup,lactose-free,whole,milk","Frozen,Cappuccino,Granita,Dessert,Recipe2,cups,extra-strong,brewed,coffee,5,teaspoons,unsweetened,cocoa,powder,1/3,cup,sugar,1/8,teaspoon,ground,cinnamon,蝧�,teaspoon,vanilla,extract,蝧�,cup,lactose-free,whole,milklow_sodiumHigh_blood_pressure, IBSvegetarian"

Add the olive oil and boiling water to the dry ingredients and mix. Knead the dough with your hands until a slightly sticky ball of dough forms. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes to hydrate the oats.

Brush or spray a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking dish with oil.
Open the packaging around the chicken and drain the liquids into the sink. Place the unwrapped chicken breast-side-up in the roasting pan. Remove the package of giblets from the cavity of the chicken, unwrap, and place them in the roasting pan. Sprinkle the chicken with poultry seasoning.
Roast for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350F. Every 30 minutes or so, baste the chicken by spooning any accumulated juices over the top and sides of the bird. Start checking the internal temperature of the chicken after it has been roasting for a total of 1蝧� hours, then check again every 15 minutes until the temperature reaches 165F in the thickest parts of both breast and thigh meat. Total cooking time will be about 2 hours for a 6-pound chicken; if yours is larger or smaller, cooking time will vary. The internal temperature is more important than the timer for gauging when the chicken is done. Allow the meat to rest for about 10 minutes before carving and serving it.
While the chicken rests, pour the juices from the roasting pan into a measuring cup; fat rises to the top in just a few moments. If more than two tablespoons of fat are present, consider removing some of it, then add water, if necessary, to the 1 cup mark.
In a small saucepan, stir together the cornstarch and cold water, then whisk in the warm juices. Over medium heat, cook the gravy, stirring frequently, until it thickens and reaches a simmer.

112,Pecan Brown Butter Oat Triangles Recipe,low_sodium,1/2 cup pecan halves 1/2 cup butter 1/4 cup light corn syrup 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1/8 tsp salt 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 1/2 cups rolled oats,"Preheat the oven to 350F. Line an 8- by an 8-inch baking dish with parchment (no greasing needed), or line with generously greased foil and set aside.
Place pecans on a baking sheet and toast in the middle of the oven until they are 1 or 2 shades darker, 7 to 9 minutes, stirring once after 4 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Remove from the oven, pour into a small bowl and place nuts in the freezer to cool until they can be handled safely. Once they are cool, coarsely chop the pecans.
In a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter while swirling the pan periodically. Adjust the heat to maintain gentle bubbling until foam turns a very light golden color and the liquid butter underneath begins to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Continue to cook and swirl the pan until the liquid butter under the foam turns copper-colored, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the corn syrup until dissolved. Stir in the brown sugar and salt and return to heat. Boil for 1 minute. Remove pan from heat again and stir in vanilla.
Add oats and pecans to the saucepan and stir to coat. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and spread evenly. Place a small piece of parchment paper or oiled foil on top of oats and press down firmly with your hand to flatten, paying attention to sides and corners. Use care: the mixture is still quite hot. Bake in the middle of the oven until the edges turn light golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes.
Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack for 15 minutes. Remove the whole bar from the pan by lifting the edges of the parchment paper and place it on a cutting board. While still warm, use a large chef's knife to cut the bar into 16 squares. Cut each square diagonally into 2 triangles (1 3/4 x 1 3/4 x 2 1/2-inch) to make 32 pieces. Cool completely, then store in an airtight container.","{'calories': '141', 'total_fat': '9g', 'saturated_fat': '4g', 'cholesterol': '15mg', 'sodium': '71mg', 'carbohydrate': '16g', 'dietry_fibre': '0g', 'sugar': '11g', 'protein': '1g', 'vitamin': 'Vitamin D 0mcg', 'calcium': '14mg', 'iron': '0mg', 'potassium': '50mg'}",Desserts,"High_blood_pressure, IBS",vegetarian,"Pecan,Brown,Butter,Oat,Triangles,Recipe","1/2,cup,pecan,halves,1/2,cup,butter,1/4,cup,light,corn,syrup,1/2,cup,packed,light,brown,sugar,1/8,tsp,salt,1,tsp,vanilla,extract,2,1/2,cups,rolled,oats","Pecan,Brown,Butter,Oat,Triangles,Recipe1/2,cup,pecan,halves,1/2,cup,butter,1/4,cup,light,corn,syrup,1/2,cup,packed,light,brown,sugar,1/8,tsp,salt,1,tsp,vanilla,extract,2,1/2,cups,rolled,oatslow_sodiumHigh_blood_pressure, IBSvegetarian"

Sift the sugar and cornstarch into a small bowl.
In an electric mixer on low speed, mix the egg whites and salt for 1 to 2 minutes, or until frothy.
Bump up the speed to medium high, gently adding the sugar and cornstarch mixture. Once the meringue is glossy and forming soft peaks (could be 5 to 10 minutes), finish on high speed and add the vanilla extract.
Spoon the merinuge onto the parchment lined baking sheet so it forms a 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick layer, making the edges slightly thicker than the center.
Bake for 80 to 90 minutes, until just beige-pink but not toasted. Turn off the heat and crack the oven door open (this prevents cracking in the meringue). Let the meringue cool to room temperature and remove.

Add oil and garlic to a large skillet and cook over low-medium heat, until garlic is fragrant and slightly golden, about 3 minutes. Be sure to stir it and watch it so that it does not burn.
Pour oil from the skillet into a small bowl. Add minced rosemary to the oil and let stand. Keep garlic in the skillet.
Add spinach to the skillet and cook over medium-high. Use tongs to toss it. Cook until just wilted, about a minute and a half (you don't want to overcook it or have a lot of liquid released). Remove from the skillet and let stand at room temperature for ten minutes.
While the spinach is cooling, place your puff pastry dough on a large piece of parchment paper. Roll it into a 20x8-inch rectangle. 
Drain any liquid released from the spinach and combine it with marinara sauce, shredded chicken breast, and ricotta cheese in a medium bowl. Stir well to combine. Drain any excess liquid out.
Spoon the spinach chicken mixture down the center of the puff pastry dough, leaving about 2.5 inches on each side and an inch at the top and bottom. Sprinkle the mozzarella on top.

When the oil is hot, drop in 3 or 4 popcorn kernels.
When the kernels pop, add the rest of the popcorn kernels in an even layer. Cover the pot, remove from heat, and count 30 seconds. This step allows all of the other kernels to get to a near-popping temperature so that when they are put back on the heat, they all pop around the same time.
After the 30 seconds, return the covered pot to the heat. The popcorn should begin popping slowly and then faster and louder. Once the popping gets going, gently shake the pot back and forth. Try to keep the lid slightly ajar to let excess steam out. Once the popping slows back down (several seconds between pops), remove the pan from the heat and take off the lid.
To make the miso peanut butter mixture: Combine the peanut butter, miso and salt in a small saucepan and gently heat over low heat, stirring often, until the mixture is slightly melty and drippy, about 5 minutes. If your mixture is too firm and not melting (this may happen depending on the type of peanut butter you have at home), add in 1/2 to 1 teaspoon extra canola oil and continue to stir. *You can also do this in the microwave: stir together the peanut butter, miso, and salt in a microwave safe bowl and heat for 15 seconds, stir, then another 10 to 15 seconds until the mixture is of desired consistency.

Keep a close eye on them so they don't burn! Once ready, remove and let cool on the side. You may have to repeat this step twice depending on how many cavities your muffin tin has.

If grilling, save a couple of tablespoons aside to toss with the vegetables.
Slice the meat into about 1/2 inch slices.

(Think about it ?嚙緙ou want to create a lot of short fibers, not a few long ones.) Even better: have the butcher at your local market cut the meat for you?嚙緙es, they will do it!
If you're cooking in a skillet, marinate everything together in a bowl or plastic bag (a zip-type works well). If you're grilling, marinate the meat and veggies separately. Even a few minutes helps, up to 2 hours is great.
If you are using a grill, heat the grill until it's hot. Make sure the grill is clean and wipe it down with oil. Then drain the marinade from the meat and vegetables and grill them?嚙箠t will only take a few minutes. I like to use a vegetable grill topper or basket for the vegetables.
For cooking in a skillet (preferably regular or cast iron, not nonstick), cook the meat first (it will probably take two batches, depending upon your pan). Add a little oil to the skillet and get it very hot (the oil will shimmer). If you don't get it hot enough (or crowd too much meat in), the meat will steam instead of browning. When the meat is browned, remove and add veggies. When they begin to soften, return meat to the skillet to heat through.
Serve with salsa, sour cream, cilantro (if desired) and guacamole. If low-carb tortillas are available, that is a nice addition, but a fork works fine.","{'calories': '283', 'total_fat': '12g', 'saturated_fat': '3g', 'cholesterol': '95mg', 'sodium': '802mg', 'carbohydrate': '5g', 'dietry_fibre': '2g', 'sugar': '2g', 'protein': '38g', 'vitamin': 'Vitamin D 0mcg', 'calcium': '41mg', 'iron': '3mg', 'potassium': '670mg'}",All,None,Non-vegetarian,"Healthy,Chicken,Beef,Fajita,Recipe","1.5-2,lbs,skirt,steak,beef,chicken,easily,cut,strips,1,medium,onion,sliced,15,medium,scallions,green,onions,2,large,bell,peppers,sliced,1/4,cup,soy,sauce,1/4,cup,lime,juice,1,tsp,chili,powder,2,tbsp,oil","Healthy,Chicken,Beef,Fajita,Recipe1.5-2,lbs,skirt,steak,beef,chicken,easily,cut,strips,1,medium,onion,sliced,15,medium,scallions,green,onions,2,large,bell,peppers,sliced,1/4,cup,soy,sauce,1/4,cup,lime,juice,1,tsp,chili,powder,2,tbsp,oillow_carbohydrateNoneNon-vegetarian"

Prepare a pan (9.5- x 13-inch sheet pan with sides works best) with lightly oiled parchment paper or a silicone mat.
First, prepare rosemary oil by combining extra virgin olive oil and a large sprig of fresh rosemary in a small pot. Heat on low until oil is warm to the touch but is not simmering (about 3 minutes). Remove from heat and steep until rosemary turns dark olive green (about 10 minutes). Remove rosemary sprig or strain and set rosemary oil aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together flaxseed meal, baking powder, fine sea salt, and sugar.
Add the beaten eggs, water, and 6 tablespoons (about 1/3 cup) of the rosemary oil to the dry ingredients and combine well. Make sure there aren't obvious strings of egg white in the batter.
Let batter set for 1 to 2 minutes to thicken up a bit (but don't leave it too long so it gets past the point where it's easy to spread).
Pour batter onto the prepared pan. Because it's going to tend to mound in the middle, you'll get a more even thickness if you spread it away from the center somewhat, in a rectangle about 1 inch from the sides of the pan or to your desired thickness. (It does not contain yeast so will not rise like regular bread.)
Using a pastry brush, gently brush the top of the dough with a thin layer of remaining rosemary oil (about 1 tablespoon) and sprinkle with flaky sea salt and rosemary leaves. Bake for about 25 minutes until it is firm and springs back when you touch the top.
Let cool slightly, cut, adn serve.","{'calories': '161', 'total_fat': '9g', 'saturated_fat': '2g', 'cholesterol': '68mg', 'sodium': '342mg', 'carbohydrate': '13g', 'dietry_fibre': '1g', 'sugar': '1g', 'protein': '5g', 'vitamin': 'Vitamin D 0mcg', 'calcium': '87mg', 'iron': '1mg', 'potassium': '90mg'}",All,None,Non-vegetarian,"Focaccia-Style,Flax,Bread,Recipe","1/2,cup,extra,virgin,olive,oil,1,large,sprig,fresh,rosemary,rinsed,dried,2,cups,flaxseed,meal,1,tbsp,baking,powder,1,tsp,fine,sea,salt,1,tbsp,sugar,6,eggs,beaten,1/2,cup,water,1/4,tsp,flaky,sea,salt,1/2,tsp,dried,fresh,rosemary,leaves","Focaccia-Style,Flax,Bread,Recipe1/2,cup,extra,virgin,olive,oil,1,large,sprig,fresh,rosemary,rinsed,dried,2,cups,flaxseed,meal,1,tbsp,baking,powder,1,tsp,fine,sea,salt,1,tbsp,sugar,6,eggs,beaten,1/2,cup,water,1/4,tsp,flaky,sea,salt,1/2,tsp,dried,fresh,rosemary,leaveslow_carbohydrateNoneNon-vegetarian"

Cover the baking sheet with sides with a silicone mat or greased parchment paper.
Roughly chop the nuts. You can do this in a food processor, but if you do, start with the harder nuts like the almonds in this recipe. Once the almonds are chopped up a bit you can add the softer nuts (walnuts, pecans). Otherwise, the softer ones will become meal before the hard ones are chopped.
Melt the coconut oil. You can microwave it in the bowl you're going to use for mixing (although you can also mix right on the baking sheet) if you wish.
Mix the syrup and coconut oil together.
Combine the nuts, coconut, sunflower seeds, flaxseed meal, and salt. If you're doing this on the baking sheet, add the water first and mix (hands work best), and then the oil and syrup mixture. Otherwise, just combine it all in a bowl and turn out onto the baking sheet. Press into an even layer.
At this point, it's good to taste it. It's going to end up tasting a little less sweet, so judge your own desire for sweetness and add more if you want.
Bake for 30-40 minutes. Twice during the baking, stir the mixture with a large spoon and press back down. After the second time, don't move it around anymore. Bake until fragrant and lightly browned on the surface.

Microwave the florets in a covered container with a small amount of water, or steam them on the stove. I've never tried boiling, but cauliflower tends to hold on to water, so I'm a little skeptical. You want them to be fork-tender (a fork slips in easily), but not overcooked (avoiding the stronger smell and flavor which develops with longer cooking).
Drain and put the cauliflower into a medium bowl. Chop the egg and add. Toss the cauliflower and egg with salt and pepper. I like quite a bit of pepper, and it does seem to take a surprising amount of salt, but this would be to taste (but you won't really know until you've got the dressing in there.)
Mix the ingredients for the dressing (mayo, lemon juice, spices, relish, etc.). Taste for the balance of flavors you like. Mix the chopped vegetables and the dressing into the cauliflower and egg mixture.

To make the dressing, in a separate small saute pan, add 2 tablespoons of reserved bacon fat, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup and pinch of salt to the same pan and warm over low heat for 2 minutes to thin the maple syrup and warm the vinaigrette.

Prepare a springform pan. To do so, place a piece of parchment paper on the circular base of the pan. There's no need to cut it to size. Simply place the side piece on top and snap it into place. Then tear or cut the excess parchment away.
Wrap the bottom and sides of the springform pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil. You'll be baking the cheesecake with the springform pan set in a baking pan half-full of boiling water, so you want to protect from leaks.
Combine all of the ingredients for the crust in a bowl, and press the mixture into the bottom of the springform pan. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until it is fragrant and beginning to brown.
Make the filling: Beat the cream cheese until fluffy. The mixture will gradually become lighter and the mixture may cling to the bowl. So scrape the sides of the bowl and the beaters and repeat the process several times. You won't be able to incorporate it later, so keep scraping and beating.
Add the spices and the maple syrup. Beat again, scrape again.
Add the pumpkin and vanilla. Beat well, scrape.
Add 3 eggs and beat well for about 1 minute, and scrape.
Add the remaining 2 eggs and the cream, and beat another minute. Pour the mixture into the pan over the crust.
Place the pan in a baking dish with at least 3-inch sides. Pour boiling water into the baking dish, about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Lower the oven temperature to 325 F and bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, checking often after 1 hour. When the cake is firm to touch but slightly soft in the center, or the center reaches 150 to 155 F, remove it from the oven.
Remove the sides from the springform pan. Let the cheesecake cool to room temperature, or up to 3 hours.

322,The Ultimate Gluten-Free Lemon Bar Recipe,low_carbohydrate,"2 cups almond flour, divided 1 cup powdered sugar, divided 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold (1 stick) 2/3 to 3/4 cup fresh lemon juice (juice from about 5 lemons) Enough water to make a total of 1 1/4 cups of liquid when added to the lemon juice 2 to 3 tsp lemon zest 5 medium eggs 1/2 cup cream 1/8 tsp kosher salt","Preheat oven to 350F.
Prepare a 13- x 9-inch pan by either buttering it very well or lining it with greased parchment paper or foil. 
For the crust, put the almond flour (reserving 1/4 cup), half of the powdered sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the lumps are gone. Alternatively, use a bowl and whisk.
Cut the cold butter into medium-sized cubes (16 cubes is about right). Add a few at a time to the mixture, either pulsing the food processor or, if mixing by hand, using a pastry blender or two table knives. Blend until the mixture looks like a crumbly meal.
Pour the mixture into the prepared pan. Smooth with your hand until crust is even, then press until firm.
Bake until just golden brown, about 15 minutes (but start checking at 10 minutes, as once it starts to brown it goes quickly). Remove the pan, then turn the oven down to 300F.
Cool the crust at room temperature for a few minutes, and then pop it into the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes, until firm (but not completely cold).
For the filling, mix all the remaining ingredients (including the reserved almond flour and powdered sugar) in a blender, and pour over the crust.
Bake until the filling is just set (the center should barely jiggle when you gently shake the pan). This should take about 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove from the oven and cool until room temperature, then place in the refrigerator and chill completely before cutting (at least 2 hours). If you like, sprinkle additional powdered sugar over the top sifting it through a sieve.","{'calories': '262', 'total_fat': '21g', 'saturated_fat': '8g', 'cholesterol': '102mg', 'sodium': '128mg', 'carbohydrate': '15g', 'dietry_fibre': '2g', 'sugar': '11g', 'protein': '6g', 'vitamin': 'Vitamin D 1mcg', 'calcium': '63mg', 'iron': '1mg', 'potassium': '167mg'}",All,None,Non-vegetarian,"The,Ultimate,Gluten-Free,Lemon,Bar,Recipe","2,cups,almond,flour,divided,1,cup,powdered,sugar,divided,1/2,tsp,salt,1/2,cup,unsalted,butter,cold,1,stick,2/3,3/4,cup,fresh,lemon,juice,juice,5,lemons,Enough,water,make,total,1,1/4,cups,liquid,added,lemon,juice,2,3,tsp,lemon,zest,5,medium,eggs,1/2,cup,cream,1/8,tsp,kosher,salt","The,Ultimate,Gluten-Free,Lemon,Bar,Recipe2,cups,almond,flour,divided,1,cup,powdered,sugar,divided,1/2,tsp,salt,1/2,cup,unsalted,butter,cold,1,stick,2/3,3/4,cup,fresh,lemon,juice,juice,5,lemons,Enough,water,make,total,1,1/4,cups,liquid,added,lemon,juice,2,3,tsp,lemon,zest,5,medium,eggs,1/2,cup,cream,1/8,tsp,kosher,saltlow_carbohydrateNoneNon-vegetarian"

Prepare a springform pan by placing a piece of parchment paper over the bottom of the pan. (You don't need to cut it to size, just snap it into place when you tighten the sides of the pan.) Butter the sides and bottom of the pan, including the parchment paper. Wrap the outside of the pan in heavy-duty foil to protect it from leaks.
In a food processor, mix together the ingredients for the crust. Press the mixture into the bottom of your springform pan. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until fragrant and beginning to brown. Remove from oven.
Lower the oven temperature to 325F.
In the bowl of a standing mixer, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Scrape sides of bowl and paddle. 
Add honey, vanilla, salt, and two of the eggs to cream cheese. Beat well, then scrape the sides of the bowl.
Add the remaining two eggs. Beat well and scrape.
Add lemon juice, lemon zest, and Greek yogurt. Beat well, scrape, and pour filling mixture over the pre-baked crust.
Place a baking pan large enough to hold your springform pan into the oven and fill it halfway with boiling water. Place the springform pan into the baking pan and bake for about 60 minutes, until the cheesecake is mostly set but is still wobbly in the middle.
While cheesecake is baking, mix together ingredients for topping in a clean bowl and set aside.
Remove cheesecake from oven, spread the topping over the cheesecake, then bake for an additional 10 minutes.

They can be as wide or as narrow as you like. Keep going until you reach the seeds (a few seeds won't matter, but you don't want it to be too seedy). You can also use a mandolin or spiralizer for this, following your gadget's instructions.
Put the zucchini strips in a colander or strainer, sprinkle with a liberal amount of salt, and toss to coat. Put the colander in a bowl and put a small plate on top to squeeze out the juice. To speed things up, put some kind of weight on the plate such as a can of food. You can leave it like this for 1 hour, or up to 24 hours (they get more solid over time, but most of the action happens in the first hour). If you think of it, toss the strips with your fingers at some point to make sure the brine is well-distributed.
Rinse the salt off and either press the excess water out (you can just return it to the colander/plate setup) or spread the ""noodles"" out on a cotton dish towel (not terry cloth, or you may get lint).
The zucchini pasta is now ready to eat (it doesn't really need cooking) but is more like pasta if gently warmed up; saute in olive oil heated to medium-high for 1 to 5 minutes.

Place rounds on a baking sheet covered with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Leave enough space between each, as you will flatten them before baking.

Preheat oven to 400F. Then, place the cubes of tofu in a bowl or baking dish and pour 1/4 cup of the marinade over the tofu. Let it marinate for about 20 minutes and then spread out evenly on a sheet tray or baking dish about 1/2 inch apart from each other (if you overcrowd the pan, the tofu will steam and not be as firm). Bake the tofu for 30 minutes or until golden-brown. Meanwhile, prep and cook your vegetables.
To blanch your broccoli, bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. While you are waiting for the water to boil, get a bowl of ice water ready so that you can use this to transfer your cooked broccoli into in order to prevent the broccoli from overcooking and maintain its bright green color. When the water comes to a boil, add your broccoli florets and cook for 2-3 minutes or just until tender (time will vary based on the size of your florets). Using a slotted spoon, remove broccoli from boiling water and transfer to the bowl with the ice water. Once it has cooled, drain and reserve for the stir fry.
Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large saute pan (large enough to fit all of the vegetables comfortably). When the oil starts to shimmer, add the sliced red peppers and saute for about 2 minutes. Then add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil and add the sliced shitake mushrooms. Saute another 2-3 minutes. Lastly, add the blanched broccoli to the same pan along with 1/2 cup of the marinade.

In an extra- large (12-inch) skillet, heat garlic-infused oil on the medium high heat. Add bell peppers and saut��� until softened, 3 minutes. Move the peppers to the side of the pan and add the ground beef. Fry beef, crumbling and stirring until browned and no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Combine meat with red peppers and stir in scallions, ground chiles, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper.
Add tomatoes and their juices, tomato paste, lentils, and water, and stir until tomato paste dissolves. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. If you won't be baking the cornbread in the skillet, carefully transfer chili to a greased 2 蝧�-quart baking dish.
While the chili is simmering, in a medium bowl combine cornmeal, sorghum flour, tapioca starch, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the egg, milk, and oil to the dry ingredients and mix until smooth. Stir in the cheddar cheese. The batter should be thick but slightly loose and almost pourable. If it's too thick, add additional milk 1-2 tablespoons at a time.

After it cools down to room temperature, cover it and store in the refrigerator overnight.
About 1蝧� hour before serving time, drain the chana dal. Cover chana dal with plenty of water in a large saucepan, and bring the uncovered pot to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain the dal in a strainer.
Return the empty pot to the stove. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil and garlic cloves over medium heat. Saut��� garlic until it begins to brown, then remove the garlic and discard it (this keeps the dish low-FODMAP).
Add the ginger and saut��� until it begins to brown. Add the chana dal, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes and chile pepper. Simmer the stew, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, peel the plantain by slicing off each end, running a sharp knife down one side, and easing the skin away in one piece. Slice the plantain into bias-cut medallions about 蝧� -inch thick, to maximize the surface area of each slice.
Pour canola oil into a medium skillet and place over medium heat. When water flicked from your fingers sizzles on contact with the surface of the oil, use tongs to lay each slice of plantain in the oil, being careful not to splash yourself. Try not to crowd the slices, as they will stick to each other; if they won't fit all at once, you may need to fry them in two batches.
Allow the plantain slices to cook, jostling them occasionally with the tongs to prevent them from sticking to the pan. When the bottom edge of a slice turns dark brown, carefully flip it to continue cooking. When both sides have become dark golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes, remove the plantain slices to a paper towel-covered plate.
Divide the stew into 5 bowls and garnish each with several slices of fried plantain.

Place the sesame seeds in a shallow bowl and roll the tofu matchsticks in the sesame seeds, gently pressing so that the seeds stick to the tofu.
Julienne the carrots or slice them into thin strips. Thinly slice the scallions and chop the spinach. Keep the herbs whole.
To assemble: Prepare a bowl of room temperature water and lay a kitchen towel on the counter. Working with one rice wrapper at a time, soak the wrapper in the water for about 15 to 30 seconds to soften. Lay it on the dish towel. Lay about two matchsticks of tofu in the center of the wrapper with a small amount of carrots, scallion, and spinach with a few herbs. Fold in both the top and bottom of the wrapper toward the center, roll the right flap all over the filling, and roll it up like a burrito until it sticks to the other side. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
To make the sauce: Whisk together the peanut butter, tamari, sesame oil, ginger, brown sugar, vinegar and chili garlic sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
Serve the summer rolls with the dipping sauce on a plate, or pack them in an airtight container for lunch to-go.","{'calories': '410', 'total_fat': '22g', 'saturated_fat': '3g', 'cholesterol': '0mg', 'sodium': '650mg', 'carbohydrate': '38g', 'dietry_fibre': '5g', 'sugar': '8g', 'protein': '20g', 'vitamin': 'Vitamin D 0mcg', 'calcium': '239mg', 'iron': '4mg', 'potassium': '623mg'}",lunch_dinner,Cancer_protection,"vegetarian, vegan","Black,Sesame,Tofu,Summer,Rolls,Recipe","1,14-ounce,package,extra,firm,tofu,drained,3,tablespoons,black,sesame,seeds,2,medium,carrots,4,small,scallions,2,cups,spinach,1/4,cup,cilantro,leaves,8,medium,rice,paper/spring,roll,wrappers,1/3,cup,peanut,butter,creamy,crunchy,3,tablespoons,tamari,low,sodium,soy,sauce,1/2,teaspoon,sesame,oil,1/4,teaspoon,ground,ginger,2,tablespoons,brown,sugar,maple,syrup,2,tablespoons,rice,vinegar,1/2,teaspoon,chili,garlic,sauce","Black,Sesame,Tofu,Summer,Rolls,Recipe1,14-ounce,package,extra,firm,tofu,drained,3,tablespoons,black,sesame,seeds,2,medium,carrots,4,small,scallions,2,cups,spinach,1/4,cup,cilantro,leaves,8,medium,rice,paper/spring,roll,wrappers,1/3,cup,peanut,butter,creamy,crunchy,3,tablespoons,tamari,low,sodium,soy,sauce,1/2,teaspoon,sesame,oil,1/4,teaspoon,ground,ginger,2,tablespoons,brown,sugar,maple,syrup,2,tablespoons,rice,vinegar,1/2,teaspoon,chili,garlic,saucehigh_fibre, high_proteinCancer_protectionvegetarian, vegan"

Sprinkle the spice mixture on both sides of each fish fillet. Spread the mixture evenly to the edges of each piece.
In a medium saucepan, stir together the chicken broth and grits; cover the pot. Over medium-high heat, bring the grits to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook the grits, stirring occasionally, until they are thickened and tender about 20 minutes. Remove pot from the heat, add half of the habanero cheddar, and stir until the cheese is melted.
While the grits are cooking, in a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet, warm the garlic-infused oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil in the pan is hot enough to sizzle a drop of water, add the fish fillets. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until thin edges become pale and opaque, then flip and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Check each fillet at its thickest point to be sure that it is done all the way through. Cooked fish is a solid white color and flakes apart easily. For best results, the entire surface of each fillet should make contact with the pan, so you may wish to cook the fish in two batches.
In each of 4 bowls, place a mound of cheese grits to one side. On the other side, arrange the lettuce and tomatoes. Top the vegetables with the cooked fish. To garnish, sprinkle each bowl with 1/4 of the remaining habanero cheddar, scallions, avocado, pumpkin seeds, and cilantro.

Divide this spice mixture in half and combine one half with a third of the yogurt and half of the minced ginger.
Cut chicken breasts into 1/2-inch thick fillets or tenders, so that they will cook properly under the broiler. Using a fork, poke holes in the surface of the chicken pieces to allow them to absorb more flavor. Place them in a large zip-top bag or flat dish, pour in the yogurt and spice mixture, seal, and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours.
About 1 1/2 hours before serving, heat a 4-quart saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. While the pan heats, add garlic-infused oil and the remaining minced ginger to the remaining half of the spice mixture; stir until this forms a thin paste. Add the paste to the hot pan and allow it to cook for 1 to 2 minutes until it is fragrant and darkens slightly. This is called ""tempering"" the spices.
Add the scallion greens, fennel bulb, and rutabaga and stir to coat with oil and spices. Sautee the vegetables until the scallion greens wilt, about 10 minutes. If the vegetables begin to stick, stir in a tablespoon of water.
Add the diced tomatoes and chicken broth. Stir to ensure that no vegetables are stuck to the bottom of the pan. Cover, bring to a low boil, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally, until rutabaga is tender.
While the sauce simmers, arrange an oven rack about 4 inches below the broiler and preheat it.
Place the marinated chicken on an oiled or foil-lined broiling pan or baking tray. Place the chicken under the broiler for 3 to 4 minutes, until it begins to brown in spots. Remove the pan, turn the chicken pieces over, and broil on the other side until chicken is fully cooked. Remove smaller pieces of chicken from the broiling pan as they become done to prevent over-cooking. Slice or cube the broiled chicken if desired.
Allow the sauce to cool for about 10 minutes until safe to handle. Use a stick blender to puree the sauce if desired or move it to a blender in batches. Stir in the rest of the yogurt and re-warm gently if necessary. Serve the chicken and sauce over cooked rice.","{'calories': '380', 'total_fat': '13g', 'saturated_fat': '3g', 'cholesterol': '100mg', 'sodium': '540mg', 'carbohydrate': '23g', 'dietry_fibre': '6g', 'sugar': '14g', 'protein': '43g', 'vitamin': 'Vitamin D 0mcg', 'calcium': '238mg', 'iron': '5mg', 'potassium': '1243mg'}",lunch_dinner,None,Non-vegetarian,"Low-FODMAP,Chicken,Tikka,Masala,Recipe","1,tablespoon,ground,cumin,1,tablespoon,paprika,2,teaspoons,garam,masala,1,teaspoon,ground,chile,pepper,1,teaspoon,ground,turmeric,1/2,teaspoon,ground,coriander,1/2,teaspoon,asafetida,see,note,1/2,teaspoon,freshly,ground,black,pepper,1/2,teaspoon,salt,1,1/2,cups,lactose-free,yogurt,divided,2,tablespoons,fresh,ginger,root,peeled,minced,divided,1,1/2,pounds,boneless,skinless,chicken,breast,3,tablespoons,garlic-infused,olive,oil,1,cup,scallion,greens,thinly,sliced,green,part,2,cups,fennel,bulb,chopped,2,cups,fresh,rutabaga,thickly,peeled,finely,chopped,1,28-ounce,crushed,tomatoes,salt,added,2,cups,reduced-sodium,low-FODMAP,chicken,broth","Low-FODMAP,Chicken,Tikka,Masala,Recipe1,tablespoon,ground,cumin,1,tablespoon,paprika,2,teaspoons,garam,masala,1,teaspoon,ground,chile,pepper,1,teaspoon,ground,turmeric,1/2,teaspoon,ground,coriander,1/2,teaspoon,asafetida,see,note,1/2,teaspoon,freshly,ground,black,pepper,1/2,teaspoon,salt,1,1/2,cups,lactose-free,yogurt,divided,2,tablespoons,fresh,ginger,root,peeled,minced,divided,1,1/2,pounds,boneless,skinless,chicken,breast,3,tablespoons,garlic-infused,olive,oil,1,cup,scallion,greens,thinly,sliced,green,part,2,cups,fennel,bulb,chopped,2,cups,fresh,rutabaga,thickly,peeled,finely,chopped,1,28-ounce,crushed,tomatoes,salt,added,2,cups,reduced-sodium,low-FODMAP,chicken,brothhigh_proteinNoneNon-vegetarian"

Grab a small bowl and stir together the boiling water, sugar, fish sauce, and lime juice until the sugar dissolves. Slice the chiles into paper-thin slices and stir them into the sauce.
In a large, covered stockpot, bring about 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Add the vermicelli and return the water to a boil, stirring gently several times to separate the block of vermicelli into strands. Begin testing for doneness after noodles have boiled about 2 minutes. When the vermicelli is tender, pour it into a strainer and rinse with cool water. 
Divide the lettuce and herbs into 6 dinner-plate-sized bowls. Julienne the unpeeled cucumber, radish, and carrot, and divide among the bowls.
Slice the scallion greens and set them aside. Trim off the roots and cut the white part (bulb) of the scallions into large pieces.
In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the scallion bulbs and allow the oil to infuse with their flavor as they cook. Adjust the heat to prevent burning, and remove the scallions when they begin to brown.
Add the ground pork and sugar and saute for 10 to 12 minutes, breaking it up into large pieces with a spatula, until browned.
Add 1/4 cup of the prepared sweet chile sauce to the skillet and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan, until it has evaporated. Remove from the heat and sprinkle with black pepper.
If necessary, loosen the vermicelli in the strainer by rinsing it again with some cold water. Arrange the noodles on top of the vegetables in the prepared bowls.

Lightly grease a baking tray and a 9x10-inch baking dish.
Slice squashes into 1/2-inch pieces and distribute in a single layer on the baking tray. Add the chopped pepper and roast until the squash appears about half done, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the oven and set aside.
Reduce the heat to 350F.
While the squash roasts, slice the chicken breasts lengthwise. Place the chicken in the bottom of a medium saucepan or Dutch oven. Add just enough water to cover the chicken and season the water with 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Bring the pot to a simmer over medium heat; do not allow it to boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the thickest part of the chicken breasts cook through, about 20 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and allow it to cool. Pour 1/2 cup of the broth into a heatproof measuring cup; reserve the rest for another use or discard.
While the chicken cools, in the same saucepan, whisk together the milk, cornstarch, ground chile, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Stir in the 1/2 cup of warm chicken broth and stir the mixture over medium heat until it thickens and begins to bubble, about 5 minutes.
Remove the white sauce from the heat. Spoon 1/2 cup sauce into the baking dish and top with 3 corn tortillas, tearing the tortillas as needed to arrange them in a single layer.
Use two forks to shred the chicken, then stir it into the sauce along with the cooked squash and peppers, 1蝧� cups of cheese, and chile flakes if using. Spread half of the mixture in the baking dish, top with three corn tortillas, then with the other half of the chicken mixture. Top with halved cherry tomatoes and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese.
Bake until the sauce bubbles and the casserole is golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.

Spray a rimmed baking sheet generously with baking spray or coat with canola oil.
In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of water and cornstarch; stir until smooth and set aside.
In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, remaining 1/3 cup water, brown sugar, ginger, mirin, and rice vinegar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring periodically. Boil for 2 minutes. Turn heat down to a simmer, re-mix the cornstarch and water, and drizzle the cornstarch mixture into the hot sauce, stirring constantly. Simmer until the mixture thickens, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.
Over a sink, place the palms of your hands flat on both sides of the tofu block and squeeze gently with even pressure, like squeezing a sponge, until it becomes more difficult to see water coming out. Cut tofu in half lengthwise, then crosswise into a total of 16 pieces about 1/3-inch thick.

Turn the tofu pieces over and return to the oven to bake until the bottoms have browned or caramelized on the edges, 8 to 10 minutes more.
While tofu is baking, in a large, covered stockpot, bring about 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Add the noodles and return the water to a boil, stirring gently several times to separate the block of noodles into strands. Begin testing for doneness after noodles have boiled about 2 minutes and continue testing at 1-minute intervals. When noodles are tender, pour them into a strainer and rinse with cool water.

Add the remaining soy sauce mixture to the wok, stir to coat vegetables, and cook about one more minute. Remove from heat and stir in sesame oil and crushed red pepper flakes, if using.

Reduce the heat, cover the pot, and simmer the potatoes for about 10 minutes. Add the kale and leek leaves; continue to simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 10 more minutes, stirring twice toward the end. Even though the kale and leaks will not be underwater when they are first added to the pot, the steam from the potato water will cook them.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it is shimmering and fragrant. Sear the salmon pieces skin side up in the hot oil until a golden brown crust has formed. Turn the salmon just once. Scrape the bottom of the frying pan with the spatula as you turn the salmon, so you don't lose the crust. Continue cooking, skin side down, until the fish is opaque when flaked with a fork. Sprinkle the salmon with dried dill.
Pouring away from you to avoid the hot steam, drain the vegetables in a colander. Return vegetables to the pot and mash them together with the milk, butter, salt, and pepper. Divide the potato mixture into serving bowls. Separate the seared salmon from the skin and place atop the potatoes. Serve drizzled with balsamic vinegar if desired.

Separate the beets from their stems and set the steams aside. Cut the tips off the beets and wrap individually in foil and place on baking sheet. Roast until tender when pierced with the knife, about 1 hour. Open foil carefully (steam will escape). Turn off the oven and let the beets cool.
Once cool enough to handle, peel the beets. Using the fine holes of a box grater, finely grate the beets into a medium bowl.
Add goat cheese and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the almond flour.
To make the ravioli: Set out a small bowl of water. Place 1 teaspoon of beet filling into the center of a wonton wrapper. Dip a brush or (use your finger) into the water and brush the edges of the wonton wrapper with water and fold the dough over the filling to form a triangle or semi-circle depending on the shape of your wrapper. Push out as much air as possible and press the edges to seal. Repeat with remaining wrappers.
To make the sauce and cook the ravioli: Finely chop the beet stems and tear the beet greens into bite-size pieces. Set aside. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add a third of the ravioli to the water and boil for 2 minutes, stirring often.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds. Add the cooked ravioli to the skillet and saute for another minute.
Place onto a plate and serve with Parmesan cheese.","{'calories': '265', 'total_fat': '9g', 'saturated_fat': '5g', 'cholesterol': '19mg', 'sodium': '654mg', 'carbohydrate': '33g', 'dietry_fibre': '4g', 'sugar': '3g', 'protein': '14g', 'vitamin': 'Vitamin D 0mcg', 'calcium': '232mg', 'iron': '2mg', 'potassium': '747mg'}",lunch_dinner,"Diabetes, Cancer_protection",vegetarian,"Red,Beet,Goat,Cheese,Ravioli,Recipe","2,medium,beets,plus,stems,greens,4,ounces,goat,cheese,2,tablespoons,almond,flour,40,small,wonton,wrappers,12-ounce,package,1,tablespoon,olive,oil,1,medium,clove,garlic,pressed,2,tablespoons,finely,grated,Parmesan,cheese","Red,Beet,Goat,Cheese,Ravioli,Recipe2,medium,beets,plus,stems,greens,4,ounces,goat,cheese,2,tablespoons,almond,flour,40,small,wonton,wrappers,12-ounce,package,1,tablespoon,olive,oil,1,medium,clove,garlic,pressed,2,tablespoons,finely,grated,Parmesan,cheesehigh_proteinDiabetes, Cancer_protectionvegetarian"
